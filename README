A very first draft of a Chrome extension that extends YubNub (yubnub.org).

YubNub is a command line for the web. A command like

bim elephants

searches Bing images with the query "elephants", while a command like

wp elephants

searches Wikipedia for "elephants".

NoStone allows commands that open in different tabs. Commands are separated by dots (.) and queries are separated by slashes (/). For example, if the user wants to search Bing images for elephants and Wikipedia for images, he can use the following command:

bim.wp elephants

This will open the Bing image search in one tab and the Wikipedia search in another tab. If the user wants to search Bing images for elephants and giraffes, he can use the command

bim elephants/giraffes

This will open the Bing image search of elephants in one tab and the Bing image search of giraffes in the other. A command like

bim.wp elephants/giraffes

will open four tabs.

Also, the options page for the extension allows users to override the universal YubNub commands.
